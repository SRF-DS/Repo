# Repo
Class Activities / Things I've solved during class time.
Repo holds assignments completed during class throughs, worksheets completed via walkthrough following along teacher insrtruction. Also in class challenges completed in breakout rooms.
This is backup storage also allows me to practice my organizational skill and keep up with with git add, commit, push.
This allows me to reinforce my learning by keep continually keeping Repo and my local directory current In future work it may also be important to have simple trackable file names, easily navigated folder organizational structure. Local Files to Match Uploaded files. If I ever did not have access to my regular main driver computer I would still be able to complete assignments or in class work from a peers computer and have easy access to files that will be review in class

TLDR; Organization Management, Practice, Failsafes, and Storage.
