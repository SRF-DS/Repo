# My First GitHub Repository
What's in this repository?
Class Activities / completed following along teacher insrtruction.
In Class Challenges / Things I've solved on my own or while collarborating with other students in breakout rooms.

File Organization Practice:
This is backup storage also allows me to practice my organizational skill and keep up with with git add, commit, push.
This allows me to reinforce my learning by keep continually keeping Repo and my local directory current In future work it may also be important to have simple trackable file names, easily navigated folder organizational structure. Local Files to Match Uploaded files. If I ever did not have access to my regular main driver computer I would still be able to complete assignments or in class work from a peers computer and have easy access to files that will be review in class

TLDR; Class Activities/ Challenges, File Organization, Practice, Failsafes, and Storage.
